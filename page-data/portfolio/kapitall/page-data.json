The founders approached me to work with them to develop a product that merged the entertainment and engagement of gaming with the strategy and power of finance.\n\nThorough research, exploration and immersion resulted in a new kind of investment platform.\n\nOne that informs, entertains, and most importantly, educates.\n\n##### The Insight\nInvesting is a gamble.\n\nThe average person lacks knowledge and is fearful of investing in the stock market or even their own retirement plans. Industry jargon and market turbulence are huge barriers to entry for the average person.\n\nThe general mindset is that the stock market is skewed towards institutional investment, leaving little room for the individual.  \n\nMy research showed that educated and engaged users quickly become proactive, successful traders. So, we developed a platform that tapped a gaming experience, and social channels, to inspire users to explore, learn and share their investment portfolios.\n\n##### The Experience\nThe focus was to create a simple experience that is fun to play, but also a powerful financial education tool. Early field and ethnography research helped us to better understand our audience's challenges, fears and barriers when it comes to investing.\n\nGeneral lack of knowledge of finance and money management was a huge barrier to entry into the stock market by the majority of people, so I set about architecting a financial education platform through a video game-like experience.\n\nThe stock market is a complex beast, so I focused on creating an intuitive and easy to use application that inspired users through quests, to explore and learn, and ultimately apply that knowledge to their own finances.\n\n##### The Result\nKapitall is the world's first gamified, drag and drop investment platform\nWe wanted learning to be fun, but applicable. As users level up they gain access to new tools that help increase their financial knowledge and trading capabilities.\n\nAs they share their experiences through social media, users can team up with other investors to teach, to learn and to win.\n\n<div class=\"contentEmbed\">\n  <h6>Kapitall product video</h6>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cPztpFPKySQ\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"></a>\n</div>"},"entryHeadline":"Kapitall.
