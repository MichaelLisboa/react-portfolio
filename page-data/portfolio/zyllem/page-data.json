The general feedback from customers was a negative experience.\nIn their infinite wisdom, Zyllem sought to solve the problem by focusing on establishing their product as the only solution for delivery services across SEA.\n#### Workshopping it\nStarting with an internal mini-workshop to zero in on user personas and journeys, then performing field research through in-person interviews and surveys, I was able to identify audience needs and went to work to solve those problems.\n#### Getting to work\nI worked in OmniGraffle to produce wireframes for all app screens for iOS and Android, and series of app task flows for documenting usr interactions and information architecture nomenclature and hierarchy. The massive UX deliverable, documents all interactions and interface elements for the Zyllem development team.\n#### Wrapping it all up\nFinally, I worked with the Zyllem folks to develop an internal UX process and product design to solve the key challenges."},"entryHeadline":"Disrupting the logistics of delivery in Southeast Asia.","entryHeroImage":{"id":"e400aaf6-caf1-522b-abf6-e2211e8401f8","file":{"fileName":"zyllem-hero.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/2wM39ZmzcqtrRd6WLCcrbE/3273561ad7bdaf4e3ab9bd907bbe99e3/zyllem-hero.jpg"}},"entryImages":[{"id":"11281e00-28a6-5261-876c-51658659252d","file":{"fileName":"zyllem-portfolio-1.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/5bcJizWYJg0Q7k4nXNm1Wr/471f586556d24dbe547294e51f558147/zyllem-portfolio-1.jpg"},"description":"Performed user research, user interviews, and task analysis to get to a series of customer personas and their challenges in shipping and delivery in SEA."},{"id":"a49e2bbe-516b-5bfd-bcc8-6ea18ac6f074","file":{"fileName":"zyllem-portfolio-2.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/6sWetzv662VO9FnKkovZXe/6314b954dad29506f999ee56f3e69059/zyllem-portfolio-2.jpg"},"description":"I worked in OmniGraffle to create wireframes for all app screens for iOS and Android."},{"id":"ed188654-5f23-5bab-9d13-817b43b1ec00","file":{"fileName":"zyllem-portfolio-3.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/3SaJEVgNQeZZN5yuzyBK6I/14363c6eb11181f75c6f4320a90a269a/zyllem-portfolio-3.jpg"},"description":"A massive UX deliverable, documenting all interactions and interface elements for the Zyllem development team."},{"id":"633c7c30-5db5-5c75-b889-8843fac0e8a0","file":{"fileName":"zyllem-portfolio-4.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/3lLDb7Na52KuM0AQEEAZUC/cfd05c4823b5d2d151f24993f6ae01e6/zyllem-portfolio-4.jpg"},"description":"A series of app task flows for documenting usr interactions and information architecture nomenclature and hierarchy."}],"entrySlug":"zyllem","entrySubHeadline":{"id":"e4774682-2cd6-5dc8-81e3-d1487b01c85f","entrySubHeadline":"Zyllem is crowdsourcing the ultimate delivery service.
