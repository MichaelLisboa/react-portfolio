Purposely choosing to avoid Redux, Axios or other packages, I was able to quickly develop a robust, component-based UI that would talk to the backend API via Django Rest Framework.\n\n##### The backend tech solution\nLucky for me, I've already developed Pixt AI, a machine learning platform that's designed to understand the emotions, behaviors and personality of pictures and videos that people upload and share, regardless of the source of the content, and deliver that previously unknown data.\n\nUsing the Pixt API, I was able to send JSON requests to receive Visual Intelligence data, then leveraging my Influen$e platform's ability to identify and define a real dollar value of visual content (pictures and videos), I had a very robust AI backend to process data and devliver on valuation.\n\nTo keep things relatively simple, I focused on Instagram's notorious API as a source of content (source of the majority of user generated content), and I've chosen Stripe as my backend payment system.\n\n##### How it works\nUsing my previously developed platforms, I made a system that synchronizes Instagram content posted by users and influencers. \n\nPixt AI processes the incoming visual content in real-time, then sends it to Influen$e to determine the value based on trend-worthiness, emotional and brand value, and more. \n\nThe final MarketWatch app interfaces with the big data backend to stream a live feed of uploaded visual content, dollar values, acquisition costs, and more in real-time.\n\n<div class=\"uk-text-center uk-padding\">\n  <a href=\"https://marketwatch.influense.me\" class=\"uk-button uk-button-danger uk-button-large\">Visit MarketWatch</a>\n</div>\n"},"entryHeadline":"How I designed & programmed the world's first real-time trading platform for visual content in just eight hours.","entryHeroImage":{"id":"d02bda55-8161-539d-a9cf-fdd279b5b2c3","file":{"fileName":"marketwatch-hero-1200.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/2uLd1la5yhH1MCkcpCtjUh/9ccaf759d769f321743f607c287f9187/marketwatch-hero-1200.png"}},"entryImages":[{"id":"e875673e-23a3-5fb0-b5ac-ed56f7111d1b","file":{"fileName":"marketwatch-detail-1.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/JbF6W4Bp8wO85QGqExXIj/c2f152bc5cf3de6dfceb87c9fe362428/marketwatch-detail-1.png"},"description":"Starting with wireframes so I can understand the interactions, API calls and coding required to make the MarketWatch come to life."},{"id":"e4ea20dc-a996-5baa-9a8a-9ca54960fc23","file":{"fileName":"marketwatch-detail-2.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/27O2vxRJkXpSbLjglZehcu/52b3bbafca2c700cd521eed460dae6ca/marketwatch-detail-2.png"},"description":"Referencing the Influen$e app I designed previously, to get to a clean and functional UI design for the MarketWatch app."},{"id":"01c35a3e-2b68-5103-afc7-89dace8954df","file":{"fileName":"marketwatch-detail-3.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/5kEQxgZchPS08sEKeCnYfO/f5c9406385ec618c20fd4d252be2d54e/marketwatch-detail-3.png"},"description":"I developed the interface in pure React, choosing to forego any complications that could rise with Redux.
