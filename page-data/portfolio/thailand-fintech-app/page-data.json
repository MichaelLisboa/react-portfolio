Smart design.\nThe answer: Atomic Design (yeah, that's a thing).\n\nEvery element was designed as a library component, which would then be developed as a modular and reusable component in the React app. That is, I could choose to export the design as images, JSON, or even ReactJS components. I mean, really, whatever-the-hell I want, as long as it gets me to a simple programming solution.\n\nTo further support the development team, as well as sell in the design to C-levels, we developed a hi-fidelity design prototype of user interactions and task flows, allowing stakeholders to view and interact with the UI on their devices."},"entryHeadline":"Designing a smarter way to transfer funds in and out of Thailand for this FinTech startup.","entryHeroImage":{"id":"38c4b1f8-fad7-51d4-bb52-524da3383830","file":{"fileName":"deemoney-splash-1500.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/fMECnUv8IKG37maBX34oo/8613648b15839dc0b9342b5da7981fc8/deemoney-splash-1500.png"}},"entryImages":[{"id":"7fe78dcb-de24-59bc-9e71-916cad7b6fe4","file":{"fileName":"deemoney-1@1x.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/2GSmuNnrdtEbp4muLm9NdP/7d5423b4e2483f7095d27fb1fcae0109/deemoney-1_1x.png"},"description":"UX and UI design of more than 150 screens for this complex FinTech app, completed in just three weeks."},{"id":"371b79ae-49a6-5ecd-b4f0-d20158e9a55c","file":{"fileName":"deemoney-2@1x.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/1YRtmcXAJT9WtnJsO7YvbU/75bb7e411d08b2cd3619a47fb6e67c35/deemoney-2_1x.png"},"description":"Using \"atomic design\" methodology, the focus was on designing interface elements as modules and components to provide an effective and usable design deliverable for the development team."},{"id":"30fc6e32-eca5-565c-9224-815f2f4b7936","file":{"fileName":"deemoney-3@1x.png","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/67X0NF8tzHKQhFhP11VGAB/eb0750de6a09b300f1b7ad69121d28e0/deemoney-3_1x.png"},"description":"Designing in a modular, component-based, process made the responsive web design a faster and more effective process."}],"entrySlug":"thailand-fintech-app","entrySubHeadline":{"id":"58a93e8a-2ea6-5340-8426-7f08ae4cd389","entrySubHeadline":"This Thailand FinTech startup is on a mission to make international banking easy and accessible to Thais and expats alike."},"entryTitle":"Thailand FinTech PWA","entryTopic":"UX/UI Design"}},"pageContext":{"entrySlug":"thailand-fintech-app"}}}
