The Facebook campaign increased Raffles' average Facebook engagement rate by over 50% in just a couple of days.\n\nWorking with the amazing Raffles team, I led the development of a social playbook and communications guidelines for the event itself. It didn't stop there, the live event took place over Facebook and Twitter, generating over 300 hundred questions.\n\nThe goal was to not only establish Raffles Hotel as the wedding experts, but also to drive sales opportunities for the Raffles business team. The event was so successful, in this regard, that we extended the campaign with a series of Facebook video posts and a Raffles Pinterest page to keep the dialog going.\n\nWhat a great experience! The Raffles Hotels team were perfect throughout, and I'm very proud of the results."},"entryHeadline":"Creating a Human Experience on social media to capture heart-share.","entryHeroImage":{"id":"6db1f0c0-c35a-5e7d-acf1-49fc03276e86","file":{"fileName":"raffles-hero.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/5GIXMwlF3Rw9klgsxBEDrc/3de1c393ce1a0d6400f7ff2e0118e0b1/raffles-hero.jpg"}},"entryImages":[{"id":"715b904a-cbb8-5afd-b2f3-4b9aa9b097fd","file":{"fileName":"raffles-1.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/I49Uh2c358xxcPQdWQMh0/fa8ce6d9088ffa15630708a6dc6222a8/raffles-1.jpg"},"description":"Social media content leading up to the Save the Date event."},{"id":"082a310a-0f3f-51ac-b1a5-b4c9fc91a688","file":{"fileName":"raffles-2.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/5kVHykPqldT0Yt4mK9Qvht/a74f8ea0ef28d210957bc551d56f1c9e/raffles-2.jpg"},"description":"A series of weekly videos after the event continued to drive awareness and bookings for Raffles Hotel."},{"id":"867c55d1-2958-58b8-b09e-1b16217b82d6","file":{"fileName":"raffles-3.jpg","url":"//images.ctfassets.net/1nc0h0ipk4bl/3Ah8lgTZerppdxg7T8xjLY/b5c3ec1d1c5bda825027ea7be2e46677/raffles-3.jpg"},"description":"A short case study video. https://vimeo.com/181173083"}],"entrySlug":"raffles-hotels","entrySubHeadline":{"id":"a81ece98-d8eb-52a4-b04c-f86de956d6f9","entrySubHeadline":"Asiaâ€™s first social media event to help people spend more time planning for their marriage and less time planning their wedding."},"entryTitle":"Raffles Hotels","entryTopic":"Advertising"}},"pageContext":{"entrySlug":"raffles-hotels"}}}
