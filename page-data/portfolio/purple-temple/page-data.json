She had a great idea, and turned to me to make it reality. \n\n##### No pictures, text only.\nI thought to myself, \"self, how would Twitter have done this 15 years ago, with the technology and bandwidth of today?\"\n\n##### The Idea\nWhat if there was a platform where brands could find their perfect match for a creative tête-à-tête?\n\nCould a luxury shoe brand find creative love with a paper manufacturer in Thailand?\n\nOr a cosmetics brand have a one off with your favorite crayons manufacturer?\n\nWhat if the next big idea came from a random brand hookup?\n\n##### The Insight\nAdvertising and communications has evolved into a complex architecture of omni-channels, mobile audiences, and social voices, creating a challenge for brand storytelling.\n\nDrastic shifts in perception and consumption of content  means brand messaging needs to be creatively agile and more in tune with audiences than ever before.\n\nSo what do they do?\n\n##### The Product Strategy\nI worked with the founder to identify core functions, market position, user goals, and communication strategy.\n\nKnowing that more and more brands are moving their creative services in house, we sought to invent a new kind of creative platform.\n\nOne where brands, big and small, could get to campaign and product ideas faster through partnering and collabrating with each other.\n\n##### The Inspiration Experience\nThe product had to be inspirational and dead-simple to use.\n\nPrompted to describe their creative idea in 20 words or less, users are encouraged to use \"twitter-style-get-to-the-point,\" messaging to easily match with other brands seeking creative partnerships throughout the world.\n\nAnd, better yet, quickly discover and deliver on their marketing goals without the friction that can arise while working with agencies.\n\n##### The Full-Stack (for you coders)\nThis PWA is designed for flexibility and extensibility. UI elements, transitions and animations are implemented to deliver the \"native app\" feel.\n\nI developed the backend as microservices / headless functions in Python, Django, and packages including NLTK, Pandas, numpy and Google Auto ML, deployed on Google Cloud.\n\n(PS., Have a look at [my Github](https://www.github.com/MichaelLisboa/) for open source code.)\n\nFor search and brand matching, I used NLTK, Word2Vec and Levenshtein distance matching to deliver high quality results that actually matter for the end-user."},"entryHeadline":"Agencies sell creative thinking.
