With a quickness.\n\nWhat if we delivered a content-rich creative strategy without actually having to create content? What if we designed a campaign powered by people? A destination for inspiration, creativity and opportunity. \n\nIn 2009.\n\n##### The new Pepsi Generation, refreshing the world in real time\nPepsi's story of \"rethink the past, refresh with the new,\" struck a chord. More so when they gave us an early look at their upcoming Bob Dylan/Will.I.Am TV spot.\n\n<div class=\"contentEmbed\">\n  <h6>The creative spark</h6>\n  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YS7BYnymQUI\" class=\"embedly-card\" data-card-width=\"100%\" data-card-controls=\"0\"></a>\n</div>\n\nCrystal clear, our mission was to refresh every experience that people have with Pepsi.\n\nWe started with refreshing the \"refresh button\".
